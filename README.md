# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Project Summary
This project aims to predict loan approval status based on applicant details such as gender, income, credit history, and employment type. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions to minimize risk and improve loan approval efficiency.

# Objective
-To analyze and preprocess loan application data.
-To identify key factors influencing loan approvals.
-To build and evaluate a machine learning model for loan approval prediction.

# Dataset
-The dataset contains information such as applicant income, credit history, employment status, marital status, loan amount, etc.
-Target variable: Loan_Status (Y/N)
-Missing values are handled using mode imputation for categorical data.

# Technologies Used
-Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
-Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
-Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and model training

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
-Visualized distributions of categorical and numerical variables.
-Analyzed correlations between features to determine key predictors.

# Model Training & Evaluation
-Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
-Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

# Results & Insights
-Identified that credit history and applicant income play a crucial role in loan approvals.
-Achieved a high accuracy score, ensuring reliable predictions.
-The model helps in automating loan approvals with minimal human intervention.
